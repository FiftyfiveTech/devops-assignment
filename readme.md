# Dockerized WordPress with Database Optimization

This project demonstrates how to Dockerize a WordPress application using best practices for Dockerfile and Docker Compose. Additionally, it includes steps for optimizing the database for improved performance.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the Dockerized WordPress application up and running.

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system. You can download it [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

### Building the Dockerized WordPress Application

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. Build the Docker images and start the containers using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This command will create and run two services: WordPress and MySQL. WordPress will be accessible at http://localhost:8080 in your web browser.

4. Access WordPress in your web browser by going to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### Stopping and Cleaning Up

To stop and remove the containers when you're done:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Database Optimization

This project uses a basic MySQL image for demonstration purposes. For production, you should consider optimizing your MySQL database for performance. Possible optimization steps include:

- Query optimization
- Indexing
- Adjusting MySQL server parameters
