# Assignment: Dockerizing WordPress with Dockerfile, Docker Compose, and Database Optimization

### Objective: The goal of this assignment is to Dockerize a WordPress application using best practices for Dockerfile and Docker Compose, as well as to optimize the database for improved performance. You are also required to create a Readme file to document your approach and provide additional notes related to the task.

Tasks:

### 1) Write a Dockerfile for WordPress:
* Create a Dockerfile for the WordPress application.
* Use an official WordPress image as the base image.
* Follow best practices for creating a Dockerfile, including minimizing layers, using appropriate labels, and securing sensitive information.
### 2) Write a Docker Compose File:
* Create a Docker Compose file (docker-compose.yml) to orchestrate the WordPress application.
* Include services for WordPress and the database (e.g., MySQL or MariaDB).
* Configure network settings and dependencies between services.
* Use environment variables to manage configuration settings securely.
### 3) Optimize the Database for Performance:
* Research and implement database optimization strategies to enhance performance.
* Consider techniques such as indexing, caching, and query optimization.
* Document the steps you took to optimize the database and explain the rationale behind each optimization.
### 4) Create a Readme File:
* Write a Readme file (README.md) that explains your approach to Dockerizing WordPress and optimizing the database.
* Provide clear instructions on how to build and run the Dockerized WordPress application using Docker Compose.
* Include any additional notes, recommendations, or challenges you encountered during the process.

## Submission Guidelines:
* Create an account on [https://github.com/]
* Fork this repository to your account.
* When completed, open a Pull Request to this main repository.
* Describe the intent of the code and the approach taken in the Pull Request description.




TASK SOUTIONS:

STEP1:
* Create a Dockerfile for the WordPress application.
* Use an official WordPress image as the base image.

FROM wordpress:latest

# Expose port 80 for HTTP
EXPOSE 80

# Entry point command to start the WordPress application
CMD ["wordpress"]

* to run the dockerfile used the command dockerbuild -t wordpress .
* after running above command dockerfile will be created

STEP2:
* Created a Docker Compose file (docker-compose.yml) to orchestrate the WordPress application.

  version: '3'

services:
  wordpress:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db
      WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: your_db_name
      WORDPRESS_DB_USER: your_db_user
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: your_db_password
    volumes:
      - wordpress_data:/var/www/html

  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: your_db_name
      MYSQL_USER: your_db_user
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: your_db_password
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: your_db_root_password
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  wordpress_data:
  db_data:
  
*   run this docker-compose.yml file
*   to run used command docker-compose up -d
*   the wordpress will run on port 8080
*   To check the status of your running containers, use the following command:
*   docker-compose ps
*   Access the WordPress site in your web browser at http://localhost .
*   After finished with Dockerized WordPress application, we can stop and remove the containers using the following command:
* docker-compose down
