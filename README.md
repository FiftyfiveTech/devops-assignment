# Assignment: Dockerizing WordPress with Dockerfile, Docker Compose, and Database Optimization

### Objective: The goal of this assignment is to Dockerize a WordPress application using best practices for Dockerfile and Docker Compose, as well as to optimize the database for improved performance. You are also required to create a Readme file to document your approach and provide additional notes related to the task.

Tasks:

### 1) Write a Dockerfile for WordPress:
* Create a Dockerfile for the WordPress application.
* Use an official WordPress image as the base image.
* Follow best practices for creating a Dockerfile, including minimizing layers, using appropriate labels, and securing sensitive information.
### 2) Write a Docker Compose File:
* Create a Docker Compose file (docker-compose.yml) to orchestrate the WordPress application.
* Include services for WordPress and the database (e.g., MySQL or MariaDB).
* Configure network settings and dependencies between services.
* Use environment variables to manage configuration settings securely.
### 3) Optimize the Database for Performance:
* Research and implement database optimization strategies to enhance performance.
* Consider techniques such as indexing, caching, and query optimization.
* Document the steps you took to optimize the database and explain the rationale behind each optimization.
### 4) Create a Readme File:
* Write a Readme file (README.md) that explains your approach to Dockerizing WordPress and optimizing the database.
* Provide clear instructions on how to build and run the Dockerized WordPress application using Docker Compose.
* Include any additional notes, recommendations, or challenges you encountered during the process.

## Submission Guidelines:
* Create an account on [https://github.com/]
* Fork this repository to your account.
* When completed, open a Pull Request to this main repository.
* Describe the intent of the code and the approach taken in the Pull Request description.


## Evaluation Criteria:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

* Adherence to Docker best practices in the Dockerfile and Docker Compose.
* Correct setup of the WordPress and database containers.
* Effective database optimization techniques applied.
* Clarity and completeness of the Readme file.
* Documentation of your approach and rationale for optimization choices.

Note: Please make sure to test your Dockerized WordPress application thoroughly to ensure it functions as expected.

Good luck with your assignment! If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.
