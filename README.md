# Dockerized WordPress Application By Akshay Jadhav

This repository contains a Dockerized WordPress application with a MySQL database, optimized for performance. My goal is to provide a reliable and efficient way to run WordPress using Docker while ensuring the database is fine-tuned for optimal performance.

## Approach

# Dockerizing WordPress

- The WordPress application is containerized using the official WordPress Docker image as the base image. This decision ensures consistency and ease of deployment across different environments.

- A separate MySQL container is used to host the database. This approach promotes data separation and scalability.

# Database Optimization

- I've focused on optimizing the database to enhance the overall performance of WordPress site. Here's how I tackled it:

  1. **Indexing:** I've identified and added indexes to frequently queried columns to speed up data retrieval. Indexes help the database locate and retrieve specific data faster.

  2. **Caching:** Object caching is implemented using Redis. This reduces the load on the database by storing frequently accessed data in memory, resulting in quicker query responses.

  3. **Query Optimization:** Slow queries have been optimized to improve query response times. This involved analyzing and rewriting inefficient queries, ensuring they execute more efficiently.

# Additional Notes and Recommendations

1.Regularly back up your database to prevent data loss. Tools like mysqldump can help with this.

2.Security: Ensure you follow best practices for securing your WordPress site, including using strong passwords, keeping your software and plugins up to date, and considering security plugins.

3.Scaling: As your site grows, you might need to monitor and scale your application. Tools like Prometheus can assist with performance monitoring.
